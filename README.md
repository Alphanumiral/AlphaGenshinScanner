this project is a work in progress but mostly feature-complete scanner for the game genshin impact. aside from needing to handle some weird edge cases and reformatting things a little bit, the main backend stuff functions as intended for the final release. the frontend will be improved aesthetically since it's very bare bones right now but it does most of what it's meant to do as well.
